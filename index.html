                    Road to become a software developer
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to keep advance through my career and do it as soon as possible. However, finding a position that can further advance my career took longer than expected. Initially, I was looking into a data science bootcamp, which was a logical next step for my data analysis experience. Then, I found out a program offered by Code Fellows and attended Code 101, where the instructor explained in which fields bootcamp excels. It helped me to realize that career development as a software developer will be far less limited compared to a data scientist for someone lacking an advanced degree.
